- The project will show you how much money you could make but also at how much risk you are taking when you assess whether to invest in an asset
- I use the Sharpe ratio technique (it compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the standard deviation of returns) along Python/Pandas on real financial data.
- Project tasks:
1. Loadind the data from /dataset/
2. Plot & summarize daily prices for Amazon and Facebook
3. Visualize & summarize daily values for the S&P 500
4. The inputs for the Sharpe Ratio: Starting with Daily Stock Returns
5. Daily S&P 500 returns
6. Calculating Excess Returns for Amazon and Facebook vs. S&P 500
7. The Sharpe Ratio, Step 1: The Average Difference in Daily Returns Stocks vs S&P 500
8. The Sharpe Ratio, Step 2: Standard Deviation of the Return Difference
9. Putting it all together
10. Conclusion
